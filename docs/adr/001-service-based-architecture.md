# Architecture Decision Record: Service-Based Architecture Refactor

## Date
2025-03-21

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The original implementation had a monolithic structure with tightly coupled components, stores, and game logic. This made the code difficult to maintain, test, and extend. The card type system was scattered across multiple files, and the state management lacked proper TypeScript type safety.

## Decision
We decided to refactor the application to:

1. **Service Layer Architecture**
   - Introduced separate services for Firebase and game logic
   - Implemented singleton pattern for service instances
   - Clear separation of concerns between data access and game logic

2. **Type System Consolidation**
   - Created dedicated types directory
   - Consolidated card types into a single source of truth
   - Implemented proper TypeScript enums and interfaces
   - Enhanced type safety across the application

3. **State Management Improvements**
   - Split game store into separate concerns
   - Added proper TypeScript types for state
   - Improved store subscription patterns

4. **Component Structure**
   - Decoupled components from direct store/Firebase access
   - Components now interact through service layer
   - Enhanced prop typing and validation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability and testability
- Enhanced type safety
- Clearer component responsibilities
- More scalable architecture for future features
- Easier onboarding for new developers

### Negative
- Increased initial complexity
- More files to manage
- Additional boilerplate for service layer

## Implementation Notes
- Services are implemented as TypeScript classes with singleton patterns
- Firebase operations are now isolated in FirebaseService
- Game logic is centralized in GameService
- Card types use enums for better type safety
- Components are more focused and easier to test
